When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you are working on a different computer or if you are working on someone else's Project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that you only pull what you need to work on instead of the entire project

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a GitHub only clone of a repository, a clone is a download of a GitHub repository you can work on locally,
a branch is a new iteration of a project for experimental work or different versions
